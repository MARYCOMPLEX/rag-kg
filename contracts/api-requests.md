# API Requests

This file is the shared queue for Frontend Agent requests when a page or component requires a backend API that is missing, incomplete, or unclear.

OpenAPI remains the single source of truth. Entries here are requests only; once accepted and implemented, the Backend Agent must update `openapi.yaml`.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `requested` | Frontend Agent has identified a missing or unclear API. |
| `accepted` | Backend Agent has accepted the request and will update OpenAPI. |
| `blocked` | More information is required before implementation. |
| `implemented` | Backend Agent has implemented the API and updated OpenAPI. |
| `verified` | Frontend Agent has integrated and tested the real API. |
